# Through My Eyes
---
_Through My Eyes_ will be a place I share my experiences with game development, hoping to be of help to any aspiring game developers or designers. It will be kind of like a blog, but also a lot like a non-blog. Stay posted if it's for you.

In this resource, I will **not** shape your journey with game development, because every person has a different goal, and yours may be far different from mine. Please do **not** interpret my words as me telling you what to do, because I will _never_ know your life and interests as well as you do, so listen to your heart instead of my words.
